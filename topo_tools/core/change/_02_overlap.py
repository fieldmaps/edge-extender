    Bbox-prefiltered join on ST_Dump-exploded parts of both layers -- never a
    bare spatial predicate in the JOIN condition, which would trigger DuckDB's
    SPATIAL_JOIN operator and its ~1x-RAM virtual reservation (see
    docs/topology.md) -- same pattern as core/match/_02_assign.py. Unlike that
    assign stage (top-1 parent per child), every pair with shared_area > 0 is
    kept: classification needs the full pair graph, not just the best match
    per fid. Native DuckDB always uses exact ST_Intersection here -- no
    point-sampling fallback (see docs/change.md for why the JS version's
    WASM-only fallback doesn't apply).
