"""Runs extend's pipeline once per parent group, in an isolated subprocess.

Each group's lines/attempt/merge run in a fresh, spawned OS process, not the
parent's shared connection -- CLAUDE.md documents a real, previously-confirmed
finding that GEOS's native heap isn't fully released between files even after
closing the DuckDB connection, which is exactly why extend() processes one
file per OS process today. A many-parent-group match() run would otherwise
hit the same failure mode in-process, just with groups substituting for
files. Data crosses the process boundary as small Parquet files, never a
shared connection (DuckDB files are single-writer).
