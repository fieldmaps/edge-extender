# Voronoi outlier investigation — RESOLVED

## Resolution summary

The collinearity degeneracy described below is fixed. `app/_03_points.py` now
decomposes each real boundary line into its own real vertex-to-vertex
segments (no geometry alteration) and caps interpolation on any segment
longer than `DISTANCE * MAX_POINTS_PER_SEGMENT` (config.py,
`MAX_POINTS_PER_SEGMENT = 100`) — this bounds the size of the largest
exactly-collinear point cluster fed to `ST_VoronoiDiagram`, independent of
that segment's raw length. Confirmed: Chad's `ST_VoronoiDiagram` step
296–387s → ~1s; full pipeline 1115s → ~20s. Algeria (previously only assumed
to share Chad's mechanism) confirmed and fixed the same way; full pipeline →
~30s. Chile, Indonesia, and Philippines all confirmed unaffected/working.

`100` was chosen as the smallest of several tested values — `ST_VoronoiDiagram`
time on `tcd_admin2.parquet` scales worse than linearly with this constant
(100→1s, 250→3.9s, 500→7.7s, 1000→13.9s, 2000→32.1s), so lower is strictly
better, with zero measured downside on files that don't hit the cap at all
(`chl`/`idn`/`phl_admin3` are byte-for-byte unaffected, since none of their
real segments exceed the cap threshold).

`app/attempt.py` additionally now computes a per-file starting `DISTANCE`:
`effective_distance = MAX(MIN(DISTANCE, natural_res), total_exterior_length /
target_point_budget)`. `natural_res` (median real segment length) lets files
with genuinely finer source detail than the default (e.g. Philippines) start
sharper instead of losing that detail to a coarser default. This is fully
independent of the segment cap above — `MAX_POINTS_PER_SEGMENT` still
protects against collinearity degeneracy no matter what this formula picks.

Three real bugs were found and fixed during implementation, not just the
core algorithm: (1) `ST_PointN`-based segment decomposition is O(n²) and
OOMs almost instantly at scale — fixed via `ST_Points`/`ST_Dump`/`LAG()`;
(2) differencing generated points against the shared-boundary zone per
segment instead of per fid caused a ~240x call-count blowup that OOM'd
Indonesia — fixed by aggregating to one multipoint per fid first; (3)
unconditionally guaranteeing one point per real segment created a floor
equal to the file's raw vertex count, which broke Philippines (13M real
vertices in its exterior boundary alone) — fixed by only capping segments
that are actually long, and letting normal segments fall back to the
original whole-line resampling formula.

## Memory ceiling: `--memory-gb` was tried, then removed

An earlier version derived `effective_distance`'s starting point from a
`--memory-gb`-parameterized point budget instead of just `min(DEFAULT_DISTANCE,
natural_res)`. Full history, for context on why that path was explored and
then abandoned:

An even earlier version used a single hardcoded value
(`TARGET_POINT_BUDGET = 5_500_000`) calibrated once against `chl_admin3`'s
RSS-peak behavior on an unconstrained dev machine. That calibration point was
never actually safe: tested inside a real `--memory=4g --memory-swap=4g` (no
swap) Docker container — the real deployment constraint, not RSS inference —
Chile OOM'd at exactly that "known-good" distance. `docker inspect`'s
`.State.OOMKilled` confirmed this is a hard kernel SIGKILL, not a catchable
`DuckDBError` — `attempt.py`'s retry-doubling loop never runs in that case,
so a budget-based approach has to avoid the ceiling in the first place, not
retry after crossing it.

The `--memory-gb` model that replaced it had two DISTANCE-independent terms
plus one DISTANCE-dependent term, fitted from probes run inside the real
container (segment decompose+remerge cost, fixed startup overhead, and a
per-point cost for the `ST_VoronoiDiagram` → join → union sequence), and
did fix the immediate problem: verified in the real 4GB container, Chad and
Algeria stayed unaffected and Chile succeeded (previously OOM'd even at the
old "calibrated" default).

It was removed anyway. `attempt.py`'s budget only ever controlled the
Voronoi resampling distance in one stage — but `_01_inputs.py`,
`_02_lines.py`, and `_05_merge.py` (the whole-table `ST_CoverageClean` pass)
have no DISTANCE lever at all and routinely exceed 4GB regardless (see "Two
more bottlenecks" below: `phl_admin3` needs ~5.9GB, `idn_admin3` ~5.4GB; a
real Colombia `match()` run peaked at 5.26GB during its merge stage, `docs/
match.md`). A container genuinely constrained to 4GB was never actually
achievable pipeline-wide, so a budget that only shaved this one stage was
mostly theater — real headroom has to come from swap or a larger container
regardless of what `attempt.py` picks. `--memory-gb` was never wired into
DuckDB's own `memory_limit` either; it only ever chose a starting distance
for a retry loop that already existed and already escalates on failure. The
one real, non-SIGKILL failure mode it also protected against (raw vertex
count alone exceeding the budget before any resampling) already degrades
gracefully without it: `attempt.py` just starts at `DEFAULT_DISTANCE` and
lets the doubling-retry loop run, same fallback path it always had for a
too-many-points failure.

## Two more bottlenecks, investigated and documented (no runtime gate added)

Two more pre-existing, out-of-scope-at-the-time bottlenecks turned up while
verifying the fix above under a real container. Both are DISTANCE-independent
(no resampling lever shrinks either) — but unlike `_03_points.py`'s raw-vertex
floor (which sits inside `attempt.py`'s retry loop and needs to pick a sane
fallback DISTANCE to avoid a nonsensical calculation), these two run in
`_01_inputs.py`/`_02_lines.py`, which have no DISTANCE at all to fall back to.
A runtime memory-budget check was built for both, then deliberately removed
(and `--memory-gb` itself was later removed entirely — see above): a real
deployment may have swap headroom beyond any stated ceiling, and a check
that can't do anything but log a line isn't worth the upkeep of the
probe-fitted constants it needs. Findings are recorded here instead so a
future OOM on one of these files points back to a known, already-diagnosed
cause.

**Docker Desktop VM memory cap gotcha, discovered mid-investigation.** Every
container test in this whole document up to this point was silently running
under Docker Desktop's VM total memory (`docker info` → `Total Memory`), not
the `--memory` flag passed to `docker run` — the flag can only ever be a
ceiling *within* whatever the VM itself has. The VM had drifted to ~3.83GB
(Docker Desktop's settings file already said 12GB; it just wasn't running
with that config — a restart picked it up with no file edits needed). This
had been silently under-testing every `--memory=4g` container in this
investigation by ~200MB, and it fully invalidated the first `idn_admin3`
"OOM" finding below — see that entry for what changed once corrected.
**Always check `docker info`'s `Total Memory` against the `--memory` flag
you're actually passing before trusting a container test.**

- **`phl_admin3` OOMs in `_01_inputs.py`'s `ST_CoverageClean` pass**
  (triggered by invalid-edge detection in the source data) — fails before
  `lines` or `attempt.py` ever run. Measured via a standalone probe against
  growing fractions of `phl_admin3`'s real 13.85M-vertex `_01` table, inside
  a real container: `peak_MB ≈ 499 + 395 × vertices_millions` (fitted over 5
  points spanning 10–100% of the real file, so this is interpolation, not
  extrapolation) — i.e. this file alone needs ~5.9GB, genuinely over a 4GB
  ceiling, with no DISTANCE-style lever able to shrink it.
- **`idn_admin3` in `_02_lines.py`'s neighbor-union bbox self-join.** The
  *first* pass at this (exploding into per-part bboxes to tighten the join,
  mirroring `_05_merge.py`'s `_05_tmp1` pattern) looked like the obvious fix
  and helped Indonesia, but **badly regressed Chile** — Chile has one
  `admin3` fid made of 3,796 tightly-clustered island parts; exploding it
  into per-part bboxes multiplies the self-join's row count far more than
  the tighter bboxes save (Chile: 3.3GB peak with the original whole-fid
  bbox vs. OOM at 10GB+ with per-part bboxes). Indonesia's own pathology is
  the opposite shape — many fids, each with a *few* parts spread *far
  apart* (one fid has 300 parts across a 2°×1.2° bbox) — so a whole-fid
  bbox there matches far more false candidates than a tight per-part one
  would. No single bbox granularity serves both shapes without materially
  more complexity (e.g. per-fid spatial clustering of parts), which was
  explicitly decided against — reverted to the original whole-fid bbox,
  unchanged from `ce7fc0f` (proven safe for Chile, zero regression risk).
  Once the Docker Desktop VM cap above was fixed, re-measurement showed
  Indonesia's original code was never algorithmically broken — it just
  genuinely needs ~5.4GB (`idn_admin3`: 7.48M vertices), confirmed via
  `chl_admin3` (3.94M vertices → 3.57GB, fits) and `idn_admin3` (7.48M
  vertices → 5.43GB, does not fit) directly bracketing the real 4GB
  pass/fail boundary.

The rest of this document is the original investigation history, kept for
context on how the root cause was diagnosed.

## Context
Ran the full 147-file `inputs/` corpus through the DuckDB pipeline (duckdb-migration
branch). Found large per-file duration outliers unrelated to file size. This doc
picks up mid-investigation into *why*.

## Already fixed and committed (not part of this investigation)
Commit `4047ae7` on `duckdb-migration`: `app/__main__.py` now isolates each file in
`input_dir` into its own subprocess (`_run_isolated`) instead of looping in one
process — fixed unbounded RSS growth (~2GB → ~19.85GB observed) across a multi-file
batch. That subprocess-isolation/batch-mode machinery was later removed entirely
when the CLI dropped multi-file support in favor of single-file-only processing
(each invocation now handles exactly one file, so there's nothing left to isolate
between). This section remains as investigation history — don't re-investigate
memory accumulation, that thread is closed.

## Outlier durations from the full clean run (subprocess-isolated, trustworthy)
| file | duration | features | exterior boundary (deg) |
|---|---|---|---|
| dza_admin2 (Algeria) | ~24min (from contaminated single-process era, NOT re-verified clean) | 1,541 | 81.2 |
| tcd_admin2 (Chad) | 1115s / ~18.6min (CLEAN, isolated, verified) | 70 | 52.9 |
| mli_admin3_v01/v02 (Mali) | 729s/814s | 701 | 71.8 |
| sau_admin1 (Saudi Arabia) | 791s | 13 | 128.8 |
| ner_admin2/v03 (Niger) | 551s/481s | 63/266 | 52.6/52.8 |
| lby_admin2 (Libya) | 481s | 22 | 59.3 |
| chl_admin3 (Chile, the "canonical" stress test) | 325s (comparatively FAST) | 345 | 1106.8 |
| idn_admin3 (Indonesia) | 459s (comparatively FAST) | 7,069 | 910.3 |
| are_admin1 (fast baseline) | 53s / 54s clean-reconfirmed | 7 | 42.3 |
| bdi_admin2 (fast baseline) | 4s clean-reconfirmed | 119 | 10.5 |

## Hypotheses tested and FALSIFIED (don't re-test these)
1. **Coastline/international-border length drives duration.** Falsified: Chile
   (1106.8° exterior boundary, the largest in the set) and Indonesia (910.3°) are
   both comparatively FAST. The slowest files (Chad, Mali, Niger, Algeria — several
   landlocked) have small exterior boundaries (52-82°), same range as the fast
   baseline files.
2. **Raw total boundary length (interior + exterior) drives duration.** Partially
   correlates but confounded: `col_admin3` and `idn_admin3` have the largest raw
   boundary lengths (6538°, 5129°) yet aren't the slowest, because their predicted
   point count (`boundary_len / DISTANCE`, DISTANCE=0.0002) exceeds
   `MAX_POINTS=10,000,000` in `app/config.py`, which almost certainly trips
   `attempt.py`'s doubling-distance retry and reprocesses them at a coarser,
   cheaper spacing. Files landing just BELOW that cap (dza_admin2, chl_admin3,
   eth_admin3_v03, ~7.7-8.5M predicted points) run at full density with no
   mitigation.
3. **Bbox-overlap false-positives in `_02_lines.py`'s neighbor-union self-join
   cause the slowdown** (hypothesis: sprawling admin polygons in Chad have
   overlapping bboxes despite not truly touching, bloating `ST_Union_Agg` /
   `ST_Difference` cost). Falsified directly for Chad: profiled with `--debug`,
   the `_02_tmp2` neighbor-union query (the exact bbox self-join in question) ran
   in **0.022s at 83MB** — trivially cheap, not the bottleneck.

## The actual finding (confirmed for Chad, NOT yet confirmed for others)
Profiled `tcd_admin2` with `--debug` in a clean isolated process. The cost is
concentrated entirely in `_04_tmp1` (`app/_04_voronoi.py`'s `ST_VoronoiDiagram`
call): **296.349 seconds at only 636MB RSS peak.**

This is the key signature: LOW memory + HIGH time. Every other slow file profiled
so far (Chile, Mexico) showed high time correlating with high memory (multi-GB).
Chad's profile is different — it's not a volume problem (only ~264K predicted
points, tiny compared to Chile's ~5.5M or Algeria's ~8M), it's an **algorithmic
degeneracy** in GEOS's Voronoi diagram computation.

**Working theory (plausible, not yet directly verified):** Chad's admin2
boundaries are likely long, straight desert lines cutting across largely featureless
terrain (common for interior administrative divisions in sparse, arid countries).
The points interpolated along these lines (`_03_points.py`, fixed spacing) would be
heavily collinear. Collinear/near-degenerate point configurations are a known
pathological case for Voronoi-diagram algorithms (can degrade toward worse-than-
O(n log n) behavior), independent of point count or memory.

The user (informed guess, not verified) believes `dza_admin2` (Algeria — also a
large, sparse, desert country with a similar administrative-boundary profile) shares
this same mechanism. Plausible but not independently confirmed — Algeria has far
more features (1,541 vs Chad's 70) and a much higher predicted point count, so it's
also possible Algeria's cost is a genuine volume story rather than a pure
degeneracy story. Worth a clean `--debug` profile of `dza_admin2` alone if this
needs to be nailed down rather than assumed.

## Suggested next steps for the Voronoi fix
1. **Verify the collinearity theory concretely** rather than assume it — e.g. check
   point configurations along `tcd_admin2`'s `_03b` table for collinearity/duplicate
   coordinates, or test whether jittering/perturbing points before
   `ST_VoronoiDiagram` avoids the pathology (would confirm root cause but isn't
   necessarily production-safe by itself).
2. **Check DuckDB/GEOS version + `ST_VoronoiDiagram` docs** for any documented
   tolerance/precision parameters that affect degenerate-input handling — per this
   repo's `CLAUDE.md` rule, verify against installed version, don't rely on
   recalled GEOS behavior.
3. Consider whether a small, targeted perturbation (e.g., tiny random jitter on
   interpolated points before Voronoi, or snapping to avoid exact collinearity)
   is an acceptable fix given the project's stated constraint: "Original geometry
   must not be touched" — but note that constraint (per existing memory
   `feedback_original_geometry_untouched`) applies to `_01`/original polygon
   boundaries, NOT to the synthetic interpolated Voronoi-generator points in
   `_03b`, so jittering generator points is likely in-bounds — confirm this
   distinction before implementing.
4. Reproduce the pathology minimally (small synthetic collinear point set) to
   confirm it's really collinearity and not something else about Chad's data
   before investing in a fix.

## How to reproduce the Chad profile
```
uv run -m app --input-file=tcd_admin2.parquet \
  --output-dir=<scratch>/clean_out --tmp-dir=<scratch>/clean_tmp \
  --debug --overwrite
```
Watch for the `_04_tmp1` query line in the log — that's the `ST_VoronoiDiagram` call.
