# Matching Reference

`edge-match` fits a **child** polygon layer into a coarser **parent**/clip layer
(e.g. admin4 into admin0), reusing `edge-extend`'s Voronoi gap-filling pipeline
under the hood, then the same `assign`/`edge-clip`/`edge-stitch` primitives `edge-mosaic`
uses. This doc covers the parts that are specific to `edge-match`: the
overlap/assignment algorithm, the per-group subprocess design, and the
constraints it inherits from `edge-extend`. See `docs/explanation/topology.md` for the
coverage-clean/`SPATIAL_JOIN` background both tools share.

## Usage

```sh
topo-tools edge-match children.geojson parents.geojson
```

```python
from topo_tools import edge_match

edge_match("admin4.geojson", "admin0.geojson", "admin4_matched.geojson")
```

`OUTPUT_FILE` (positional, optional) defaults to `INPUT_FILE` with a
`_matched` suffix; it is required when `INPUT_FILE` is a glob matching more
than one file, or when `--input` is given.

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--input` | Extra children file(s), repeatable and comma-separable, combined with `INPUT_FILE`. |
| `--overwrite` | Overwrite an existing output file. |
| `--threads` | DuckDB thread count. |
| `--debug` | Keep intermediate tables, export to Parquet, log timing/memory per query. |
| `--tmp-dir` | Intermediate DuckDB + Parquet location. |
| `--step` | Run only one named stage: `inputs`, `assign`, `groups`, `edge-clip`, `edge-stitch`, `outputs`. Unavailable when multiple children files are given. |

```sh
# Fit an admin4 layer into a single country boundary
topo-tools edge-match adm4.geojson adm0.geojson

# Fit admin3 into admin2 groups, each cleaned against its own parent
topo-tools edge-match adm3.gpkg adm2.gpkg adm3_matched.gpkg

# Combine several raw countries' admin1 layers, matched and extended
# together against one shared parent
topo-tools edge-match sen_adm1.parquet world_adm0.geojson out.parquet \
  --input gmb_adm1.parquet,gnb_adm1.parquet
```

Each parent's group of children runs in its own isolated subprocess, so a run
with many parents (e.g. matching a nationwide admin4 layer against dozens of
admin2 units) scales without one large group's memory use affecting another's.

Run `topo-tools edge-match --help` for the full, always-current option list.

## Pipeline

1. **`_01_inputs`**: coverage-cleans the child layer via the shared
   `core.io.read_reproject_and_clean()` helper (`{name}_child_01`), and
   loads the parent/clip layer raw via `core.assign.load_parent()`
   (`{name}_parent_01`), the same loader `edge-mosaic` uses (see
   `docs/adr/0086`).
2. **assign**: calls `core.assign.assign_many()` directly: assigns each
   child to the parent it shares the largest area with (plurality, not
   majority); drops and logs children with zero overlap with any parent,
   keeping their geometry for the issues report (or, when `merge` is set,
   for the orphan group below instead; see "Parent gap-fill and child
   passthrough"). See `docs/explanation/assign.md` for the algorithm.
3. **`_02_groups`**: groups children by their assigned parent (always, even
   a group of exactly one parent), runs `edge-extend`'s pipeline within each group
   in an isolated subprocess, then reassembles the survivors, tagging each
   row with its group's own `parent_fid`. No clipping happens here anymore
   (see "Two subprocess generations" below). A failed group's children are
   recorded, with the parent id and failure reason, for the issues report.
   When `merge` is set and any children were unassigned, one more orphan
   group runs afterward (see "Parent gap-fill and child passthrough").
4. **`_03_clip`**: one batched call into `core.edge_clip.main()` over every
   real group's rows at once, clipping each to its own `parent_fid`'s
   geometry. See `docs/explanation/edge_clip.md` for the algorithm. The
   orphan group's rows (when present) are split out first and unioned back
   in afterward, unclipped. When `merge` is set, the api layer then calls
   the shared `core.assign.fill_unmatched_parents()` to append every
   zero-children parent's own geometry, before stitch ever runs.
5. **`_04_stitch`**: calls `core.edge_stitch._02_clean.main()` directly: a
   single whole-table `ST_CoverageClean` pass over the clipped output to
   close cross-group seams. See `docs/explanation/edge_stitch.md`.
6. **`_05_outputs`**: validates topology (any overlap, or a gap at or below
   `SNAP_TOLERANCE`, raises), builds the issues report from the dropped
   children collected in stages 2/3 (or the passthrough children and
   gap-filled parents, when `merge` is set) plus any leftover gap wider
   than `SNAP_TOLERANCE`, logs a warning if any such gap remains, and
   exports both the final layer and the issues report (only when it has
   rows).

## Multi-file children

The child role MAY span multiple files in one call (e.g. one raw admin
boundary file per country); the parent/clip layer stays single-file.
`output_path` MUST be given explicitly whenever multiple paths are passed,
and `step`/`multi_parent` MUST both be `None`/`False` (see `docs/adr/0084`).

With more than one input path, `_match_multi_file()` (`api/edge_match.py`)
runs only `inputs`+`assign` in a per-file loop, mirroring `edge-mosaic`'s own
`_mosaic_multi_file()` memory-bounded pattern (`docs/explanation/edge_mosaic.md`)
but stopping one stage earlier: the parent is loaded once into a pristine
snapshot with its heavy-part tile decomposition cached
(`core.assign.prepare_parent_tiles()`), then each children file is loaded and
assigned alone against a fresh copy of that snapshot, one at a time, folding
`{name}_child_01`, `{name}_02_assign`, and `{name}_02_unassigned` into running
accumulators (`UNION ALL BY NAME`) rather than holding every file until a
final combine. `fid` is kept globally unique via a running offset applied
right after each file's assign step. `groups`, `clip`, `stitch`, and
`outputs` all run exactly once afterward, over the fully accumulated result,
not per file: grouping is keyed purely by `parent_fid`
(`_02_groups.py::list_groups`), so children from different files sharing a
`parent_fid` extend together as one Voronoi group only if groups runs after
every file's children have landed in `{name}_02_assign`, which is the whole
point of combining files here (unlike `edge-mosaic`, whose clip step is
embarrassingly per-file and folds directly into its loop instead).

`assign_one` narrows `{name}_parent_01` to only that iteration's matched
fids at the end of every call, so the loop resets it from the full snapshot
at the start of every iteration, and restores it once more from the
snapshot after the loop ends, before `groups` runs; otherwise `groups`/`clip`
would only see the last file's matched parents, not the union across all
files. Every row on the internal `{name}_05` table still carries a `source_file`
column tagging its origin file; it's an `assign-one` working column,
stripped before the exported output (see `docs/adr/0087`).

## Two subprocess generations: edge-extend, then batched edge-clip

Before the `assign`/`edge-clip`/`edge-stitch` extraction, each group's subprocess ran
`edge-extend`'s pipeline *and* clipped to that group's parent in the same
process. `core.edge_clip` now always isolates per distinct `parent_fid` in its
own spawned subprocess, uniformly for every caller, so `edge-match` moved to two
subprocess generations per run instead: a per-group `edge-extend`-only
subprocess (unchanged in count/shape from before), followed by a second,
later generation of per-`parent_fid` clip subprocesses (`edge-clip`'s own
mechanism, batched over the whole reassembled table). See
`docs/adr/0020-match-clip-two-subprocess-generations.md` for the empirical
re-verification this required and its results.

One consequence: a single bad `parent_fid` in the `edge-clip` step now aborts
the whole run, rather than edge-match's old per-group continue-past-failure
behavior for clip failures specifically. Per-group `edge-extend` failures (OOM,
or exhausting `attempt.py`'s 10 retries) still continue, dropping just that
group, as before; only clip's own hard-fail-on-first-bad-`parent_fid`
semantics are new, and apply uniformly to every `edge-clip` caller including
`edge-match` (see `docs/explanation/edge_clip.md`).

## Parent gap-fill and child passthrough

Both opt-in via the single boolean `merge` flag (CLI: `--merge`), off by
default, the same flag `edge-mosaic` uses (see
`docs/explanation/edge_mosaic.md`); `--parent-include`/`--parent-exclude`/
`--child-include`/`--child-exclude`/`--prefer` further narrow which
columns survive (see `docs/explanation/assign.md`).

**Child passthrough.** `edge-match` uses `assign-many`, a per-child (not
per-file) assignment strategy, so its passthrough granularity is
per-child: a child with zero overlap with any parent is dropped by
default, the same as always; with `merge` set, that child (along with
every other zero-overlap child, if any) is instead grouped into one
orphan group of its own, tagged with the reserved sentinel
`PASSTHROUGH_PARENT_FID` (`-1`, guaranteed absent from real parent fids)
instead of a real `parent_fid`, and run through the identical per-group
`edge-extend` subprocess as every other group. Extension only needs a
group's own children, never a parent, so a group made of nothing but
orphans extends exactly like any other group; it just never gets clipped
afterward (`_03_clip` splits sentinel rows out before calling
`core.edge_clip.main()`, unions them back into `{name}_04` afterward,
unclipped), since there is no parent to clip against. A
successfully-extended orphan is reported as a `kind='passthrough'` issues
row rather than `unassigned`; an orphan group whose extension itself
fails still becomes a `kind='dropped_group'` row, same as any other
failed group. Any merged parent columns (see `docs/explanation/assign.md`)
are NULL on passthrough rows, since there's no parent to join against;
`_02_groups.py`'s `INSERT INTO ... BY NAME` fills them in automatically
once the orphan group is appended after every real group (ordering
matters: appending it first would create `{name}_03a}` without the
carried columns, and a later real group's `INSERT ... BY NAME` would then
fail with extra, unmatched columns).

**Parent gap-fill.** A parent matched by zero children is dropped by
default; with `merge` set, that parent's own geometry and carried columns
are kept in the output unclipped instead, reported as a `kind='gap-fill'`
row. This is the shared `core.assign.fill_unmatched_parents()` helper
(the same one `edge-mosaic` calls), called from the api layer right after
`_03_clip`'s `core.edge_clip.main()` call returns, against a
`{name}_parent_full` snapshot taken before assign narrows
`{name}_parent_01` to only-matched fids. Both mechanisms are identical in
outcome to `edge-mosaic`'s own `merge`, given an equivalent
raw/already-extended child set against the same parent (see
`docs/adr/0088`).

**Materially weaker safety profile than `edge-mosaic`'s child
passthrough.** `edge-mosaic`'s passthrough geometry was already a
finished, validated `edge_extend()` output before the run even started.
`edge-match`'s orphan group is extended fresh, alone, with zero
neighboring-parent context of any kind, and its own per-group extension
has no majority/plurality vote to fall back on if the extension
misbehaves (there was nothing to vote on, unlike a normal multi-child
group where other children can outvote one bad one). Treat the two
child-passthrough modes as different risk profiles, not interchangeable;
a passthrough-heavy `edge-match` run is worth a visual spot-check (e.g.
via the `geo-preview` skill) before trusting it the way a normal matched
group would be trusted. Parent gap-fill carries no such asymmetry: both
tools keep the same unclipped parent geometry the same way.

## Per-group subprocess isolation (edge-extend)

Each group's `edge-extend` pipeline (`_02_lines` → `attempt` → `_05_merge`) runs in
its own fresh `multiprocessing` (`spawn` context) subprocess, not the parent
`edge_match()` call's shared connection. This is a deliberate design choice, not
an afterthought: CLAUDE.md documents a real, previously-confirmed finding
that GEOS's native heap isn't fully released between files even after
closing the DuckDB connection, which is exactly why `edge_extend()` processes one
file per OS process today. A many-parent-group `edge_match()` run (e.g.
admin4-into-admin2 for a country with dozens or hundreds of admin2 units)
would hit the identical failure mode in-process, just with groups
substituting for files, if groups shared one process. Building the same
per-file-per-process isolation guarantee down to group granularity avoids
that outright rather than hoping in-process cleanup is sufficient.

Data crosses the process boundary as small Parquet files (`child.parquet`,
`parent.parquet` in, `output.parquet` out), never a shared connection: a
DuckDB file is single-writer, and the group's own DuckDB file
(`group.duckdb`) lives entirely inside that group's private temp directory,
discarded when the group finishes (unless `--debug`). Verified empirically
that a `GEOMETRY` column round-trips correctly through
`COPY ... TO (FORMAT PARQUET)` + `read_parquet(...)` in the installed DuckDB
version; no `GEOPARQUET_VERSION` option is needed for this internal,
DuckDB-to-DuckDB round trip.

`edge_match()` raises only if **no** group produced any output at all (see
"Two subprocess generations" above for the separate, stricter clip-stage
failure behavior).

A freshly-spawned process has no logging configuration of its own
(`basicConfig` only ever runs in `cli/main.py`, in the parent process); the
worker puts a success/error signal on a `multiprocessing.Queue` instead of
relying solely on its own log output, and only configures logging locally
(mirroring `cli/main.py`'s own call, teed to a per-group log file) when
`--debug` is set, so `ProfiledConnection`'s per-query timing/RSS output isn't
silently dropped during a debug run.

**Real-world smoke test**: `bdi_admin4.gpkg` (3,067 features) matched against
`bdi_admin2.parquet` (119 parents) completed successfully end-to-end: 119
subprocess spawns, zero dropped children, zero failed groups, valid output
coverage (see verification steps in the project's implementation history).

**Colombia-scale profiling** (portolan `col/latest/adm3` → `col/latest/adm2`,
`--debug`, Apple Silicon/10 logical cores): 31,880 children against 1,122
parents, 1,120 of them with at least one assigned child (the other 2 parents
had zero overlapping children (not a failure, no adm3 unit fell inside
them). All 1,120 groups and all 1,120 clip subprocesses succeeded: zero
dropped children, zero failed groups. Wall time 38m23s, peak RSS 7.23 GB
(see `docs/adr/0020` for the full before/after comparison against the
pre-extraction fused-subprocess design). Stage breakdown:

| Stage    | Wall time | Share |
| -------- | --------- | ----- |
| inputs   | 59s       | 3%    |
| assign   | 10s       | 0%    |
| groups   | 29m24s    | 77%   |
| clip     | 5m13s     | 14%   |
| stitch   | 46s       | 2%    |
| outputs  | 1m51s     | 4%    |

`groups` still dominates as expected (1,120 sequential subprocess spawns,
each running the per-group `edge-extend` pipeline) but no longer accounts for
the clip work it used to do inline; that now shows up as its own `edge-clip`
stage, batched over all 1,120 parent fids after every group has finished.

## Rejected: `ST_Snap` around the clip step's `ST_Intersection`

`_05_merge.py` snapping the Voronoi cell onto its neighbor union before
`ST_Difference` (see `docs/explanation/topology.md`) measurably reduces how many
untouched fids the final whole-table `ST_CoverageClean` pass has to touch,
because many *independent* per-fid `ST_Difference` calls against
*independently computed* neighbor unions invent slightly different
floating-point crossing points for what should be the same vertex. Two
variants of the same idea were tried in what was then `edge-match`'s own inline
clip step (now `core.edge_clip`), on the theory that a shared, exact parent
boundary (the parent layer was coverage-cleaned in `_01_inputs.py` at the
time, so two adjacent parents' shared edge was vertex-identical) should let
two independently-clipped groups tile seamlessly if their output vertices
land on that same exact reference:

1. Snap each group's pre-clip geometry onto the parent's vertices, *before*
   `ST_Intersection(t.geom, p.geom)`.
2. Snap the clipped *result* onto the parent's vertices, *after* the
   intersection: the mirror image, covering the case where `ST_Intersection`
   itself perturbs the parent's inherited edge vertices during overlay
   processing rather than `t.geom`'s own vertices being the problem.

Tested both on Burundi, Sri Lanka, Malawi, Senegal, Haiti, Guatemala, and
Chile (admin2-into-admin1 for the first six, admin3-into-admin2 for Chile):
**zero measurable difference**, either direction, on every metric checked
(pre-clean invalid-edge flag, count of fids the clean pass actually
touches, whole-table clean peak RSS, wall time): identical or noise-level
(<10%, no consistent direction) on all seven files, including Chile's
56-group stress test (213/213 fids touched both ways, ~2550 MB peak all
three variants).

Root cause, found by extracting the actual invalid-edge geometries on
Burundi (`ST_CoverageInvalidEdges_Agg`, unnested, joined back to nearby
fids): all 171 invalid edges border exactly the fid pairs the assign step
places in two *different* parent groups, confirming these are genuinely
cross-group seams, but their lengths run from slivers up to **0.0058°
(~645 m)**, averaging **~12 m**. `SNAP_TOLERANCE` is `1e-8°` (~1.1 mm),
five to six orders of magnitude smaller. This isn't the same failure mode
as `_05_merge.py` at all: it's not two computations of the same crossing
point disagreeing by float noise, it's two *different* groups' Voronoi
extensions, built independently, with no knowledge of each other,
genuinely disagreeing about how far to reach near their shared parent
border. No vertex-snapping tolerance in a sane range closes a
meters-to-hundreds-of-meters gap; that's real gap-filling work, which is
exactly what `edge-stitch`'s whole-table `ST_CoverageClean` pass is for (see
`docs/explanation/edge_stitch.md`). Reverted both variants; the clip step stays
a plain `ST_Intersection`. This null result is also why `_01_inputs.py`
later dropped coverage-cleaning the parent layer entirely: seam quality
never came from parent vertex identity in the first place (see
`docs/adr/0086`).

## `check_valid_topology` and parent-layer gaps

`_05_outputs.py` calls `check_valid_topology(conn, f"{name}_05")`, relying
on its default `gap_maximum_width=SNAP_TOLERANCE` (see `docs/adr/0039`): it
still raises on any overlap or mismatched edge, but only raises on a gap
at or below `SNAP_TOLERANCE`, not any gap.

A zero-tolerance gate here breaks on a real case: matching South Africa's
admin4 into South Africa's own admin0 boundary correctly reproduces the
interior hole for Lesotho, a country fully enclosed by South Africa's
territory. That hole isn't a defect `edge-match` introduced, it's the parent
layer's own legitimate shape, and the old strict gate raised
`RuntimeError` over it. `edge-match` has no way to distinguish that case from
an actual coverage defect by size alone (both can be wide), so instead of
guessing, it stops treating "wide gap" as fatal and reports it: any gap
wider than `SNAP_TOLERANCE` gets a `kind='gap'` row in the issues report
(width, area, thinness ratio) and a warning log, for a human to review.
Only a leftover gap at or below `SNAP_TOLERANCE` still raises, since
nothing that small should ever survive the pipeline's own noise-floor
cleaning passes; a leftover one there is unambiguously a bug, not a real
absence. See `docs/adr/0035`.

## Debug tables

`--step=groups --debug` exports everything currently in the connection
(`{name}_child_01`, `{name}_parent_01`, `{name}_02_pairs`, `{name}_02_assign`,
`{name}_02_unassigned`, `{name}_03a`, `{name}_03b`), the same as a full run:
group ids
aren't known ahead of time, so there's no static table list to filter to for
that step. Per-group internal detail (the group's own `group.duckdb`,
`group.log`, `child.parquet`, `parent.parquet`, `output.parquet`) is
preserved under `{tmp_dir}/{name}_g{parent_fid}/` when `--debug` is set,
inspectable independently of the main connection's exports. `--step=clip
--debug` similarly preserves each `parent_fid`'s own
`{tmp_dir}/{name}_04_p{parent_fid}/` directory.

## Opt-in `schema-fill` composition (`fill_schema`)

`edge-match` MAY invoke `schema-fill`'s own fill logic itself, right after
stitching and before export, via `fill_schema=True` (CLI:
`--fill-schema`). This lives entirely in `api/edge_match.py`, at both
insertion points (the single-file step loop's `outputs` branch and
`_match_multi_file()`'s own final stage), calling
`core.schema_fill._02_fill.main()` directly through the private
`api._schema_fill_compose` helper; `core.edge_match` itself is unchanged
and still MUST NOT depend on `core.schema_fill`/`core.schema_map` (see
`docs/reference/shared.md`, `docs/adr/0095`).

`fill_schema` and `merge` are conceptually complementary but
independently gated flags, not aliases: `merge`'s own
`fill_unmatched_parents()` (`docs/adr/0083`) fills a *geometry-coverage*
gap, a parent with zero matched children, by keeping its own unclipped
geometry in the output; `fill_schema` fills a *schema-depth* gap, a row
whose admin-hierarchy columns don't reach as deep as some other row's,
by cascading each column family down to the row's own real depth. Both
can be set together freely; neither implies the other.
