## [Unreleased]

### Removed

- `clean`: sliver detection/reporting (`--sliver-tolerance`, issues-file
  `kind='sliver'` rows). Detection was unreliable even at tiny real-data
  scale (OOM confirmed on a 21-fid Angola admin1 file) and slivers were
  never auto-fixable in the first place -- see `docs/clean.md`. `clean` now
  only detects/fixes gaps and overlaps.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-10

Initial release: four tools, CLI + Python API for each.

- `extend` — Voronoi-based polygon boundary extension, producing a complete
  coverage layer that fills gaps.
- `match` — fits a child polygon layer into a coarser parent/clip layer by
  largest-overlap assignment, then runs `extend`'s pipeline per group.
- `clean` — detects and fixes coverage gaps/overlaps via `ST_CoverageClean`;
  detects (but never auto-fixes) slivers, reported separately for review.
- `change` — compares two versions of a polygon layer and classifies every
  unit as unchanged/renamed/modified/relocated/split/merge/complex/created/
  removed, via spatial overlap and optional code/name identity linking.
